Metadata Description:
These files contain location information (e.g., state, county, NEON domain), point geocoordinates, and GIS-derived land cover classes and soil types at locations where NEON terrestrial sampling occurs.      

The metadata package contains 2 files:
TOSplotSpatialData - Geocoordinates for centroids of plots where NEON terrestrial sampling occurs, plot sizes, land cover classes, and soil types.
TOSplotSpatialData - Geocoordinates for sub-locations within plots where NEON terrestrial sampling occurs.  


Term descriptions, data types, and units can be found in:
TOSspatialData_variables.csv - Descriptions of all fields used in the above files.


These metadata are considered provisional; collection of coordinates and QA/QC is still ongoing.  Updates will occur on an as-needed basis.
