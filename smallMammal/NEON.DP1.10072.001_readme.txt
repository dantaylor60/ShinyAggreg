Data Product Description

This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's small mammal sampling protocol. Small mammal abundance and diversity are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites. Sampling is based on the lunar calendar, with timing of sampling constrained to occur within 10 days before or after the new moon. Sampling may occur as frequently as every new moon (i.e., 12 or 13 times per year) or as infrequently as 4 times per year (i.e., every other new moon from April - October), depending on logistical constraints (e.g., deep snow, limited labor resources). Small mammals are sampled using box traps (models LFA, XLK, H.B. Sherman Traps, Inc., Tallahassee, FL, USA) arrayed in three to eight (depending on the size of the site) 10 x 10 grids with 10m spacing between traps. For additional details on protocol, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Small Mammal Sampling (url). Products resulting from this sampling include the species identification and unique identifier for each individual captured, as well as a suite of standard size measurements and reproductive condition data. Unique identifiers are in the format: NEON.MAM.DXX.XXXXXX, where the last 6 characters include either (1) the last 6 characters of the serial number of the PIT tag or (2) the 4 digit ear tag.

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2017). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis. Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs. Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.

Change log:
11/20/2014: Corrected pertrapnight duplicate records test
11/20/2014: Corrected calculation of setTraps and disturbedTraps to include only unique values of trapCoordinates to prevent errors arising from duplicate records
11/20/2014: Corrected algorithm to assign reproductiveCondition
11/20/2014: Disabled orderTagIDRecaptureQF algorithm, default value of '-1' assigned to all records, awaiting further development of database and querying infrastructure
11/20/2014: Updated consistencyTagIDTaxonIDQF to run majority rule test where taxonIDs are NOT NULL
11/20/2014: Removed values in pregnancyStatus where sex == �M�
11/20/2014: All data have been reprocessed incorporating the above changes.
