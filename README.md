# ShinyAggreg
shiny app to aggregate NEON data

The folders carabid, mosquito, pathogen, plantPresenceCover, and smallMammal contain the NEON data for these taxa available on August 20 of 2016. The files ui.R and server.R contain the R code to build and open the aggregation online app.  

If the data and code are downloaded to run on a local machine:

1. change the directory to where the data and code were saved into,
2. do library(shiny)
3. source the ui.R file
