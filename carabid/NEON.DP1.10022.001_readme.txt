Data Product Description

This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's ground beetle sampling and specimen processing protocols. Ground beetle abundance and diversity are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites.  Sampling occurs biweekly throughout the growing season, or from 15 April through 17 September, whichever is shorter.  Ground beetles are sampled using pitfall traps (16 oz deli containers filled with propylene glycol).  Four traps are deployed in each of 10 plots at each NEON site, with traps arrayed approximately 20 meters from the center of the plot in each of the four cardinal directions.  Following trap collection, Carabid beetles are sorted by NEON technicians, identified to species or morphospecies, and a subset of these are pointed or pinned. A value of 'vial of pooled individuals' in the specimenSource field of the IDandpinning table indicates that the same individual beetle was tallied in both the sorting and IDandpinning tables; users wishing to calculate total abundance or diversity metrics should account for this in any analyses to avoid double counting.  For additional protocol details, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle Sampling and the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle and Mosquito Specimen Processing. Products resulting from ground beetle sampling include parataxonomist species identifications and/or morphospecies identifications of all ground beetles, counts of common carabids, which are archived in bulk, and a unique identifier for each individual pinned or pointed.  Future updates to this product will include expert taxonomist and/or DNA barcoding identification of a subset of individuals.

File naming convention for NEON observation systems data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC, where:
- NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI
- DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 � D20)
- SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code
- DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level
- PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)
- REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product; it is also used to track �Data Product Maturity�, from Engineering �Grade/Provisional to Science-Grade (001 = initial REV, Engineering-Grade or Provisional; 101 = initial REV, Science-Grade)
- DESC is an abbreviated description of the data product
