Data Product Description

This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's ground beetle sampling and specimen processing protocols. Ground beetle abundance and diversity are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites.  Sampling occurs biweekly throughout the growing season, or from 15 April through 17 September, whichever is shorter.  Ground beetles are sampled using pitfall traps (16 oz deli containers filled with propylene glycol).  Four traps are deployed in each of 10 plots at each NEON site, with traps arrayed approximately 20 meters from the center of the plot in each of the four cardinal directions.  Following trap collection, Carabid beetles are sorted by NEON technicians, identified to species or morphospecies, and a subset of these are pointed or pinned. A value of 'vial of pooled individuals' in the specimenSource field of the IDandpinning table indicates that the same individual beetle was tallied in both the sorting and IDandpinning tables; users wishing to calculate total abundance or diversity metrics should account for this in any analyses to avoid double counting.  For additional protocol details, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle Sampling and the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Ground Beetle and Mosquito Specimen Processing. Products resulting from ground beetle sampling include parataxonomist species identifications and/or morphospecies identifications of all ground beetles, counts of common carabids, which are archived in bulk, and a unique identifier for each individual pinned or pointed.  Future updates to this product will include expert taxonomist and/or DNA barcoding identification of a subset of individuals.

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2017). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis. Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs. Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.
